## Usage

*example.py* include simply example, which download <a href="https://github.com/wleng2001/PNG-Prime_Number_Generator">PNG</a> program.
If you want check, that is required new version of app you should use the fucntion:
#### `update_check( last_update, repo_name)`
*Last_update* is argument, which takes date of last update app in format YYYY-MM-DD
*repo_name* is argument, which takes repo name (in example it was *PNG-Prime_Number_Generator*)

If you want to download file from repository you should use:
#### `download_update_file( url,'path, file_name)`
where *url* is url to raw format file (you can take it from for example rawgit.net).
*path* is location on your computer where you want to download file.

If you want to download repository you should use:
#### `download_update_repo( url, path)`
where *url* is url to github repository (in example it was *https://github.com/wleng2001/PNG-Prime_Number_Generator*).
*path* is location on your computer where you want to download repository.

If you want to update UPM you should use the function:
#### `update_self( terminal_mode)`
It checks, and ask you about insalling new version of updater:
####
````
Update of updater is available!
Do you want download it now (Y/n): y
Updater was updated.
````
At the moment it has only terminal mode, but I take not required argument *terminal_mode* for the future.
